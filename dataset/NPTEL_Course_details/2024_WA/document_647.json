    "content": "The course introduces to the various engineering aspects of polymers and composites. It discusses the unique mechanical properties that these materials offer over metals and how they are related to the structure of the materials. It teaches the mechanics of these materials that include the viscoelastic analysis of polymers and classical lamination theory for composite laminates. It also describes the failure behavior and design aspects of these materials. The course prepares a student to work on research and engineering problems related to polymers and composites."
