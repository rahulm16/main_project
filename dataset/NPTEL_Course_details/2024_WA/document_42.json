    "content": "With rising proof of climate change due to global warming, there is a demand for a more sustainable way of building. The building sector is now regulated for the purpose of implementing measures that aim toward sustainability. One of the best ways to practice sustainability in construction is through the materials that are used. Appropriate choice of materials benefit the environment by reducing the carbon footprint of the buildings. They promote a cleaner Earth and a future of sustainability while also being aesthetically appealing and much more efficient. This course focusses on four types of materials that can lead to green and sustainable buildings. These are Traditional Building materials, Alternate Building materials (Non-Conventional Building Materials), Innovative Building Materials (Green and Sustainable Materials) and Smart Building materials (Incorporating Nano-Technology).\nSome of these building materials are highly durable and can incorporate different technologies, such as capturing energy, capturing Co2 while removing pollution. This course is further aimed to make you think about developing your own innovative building material leading to patency."
