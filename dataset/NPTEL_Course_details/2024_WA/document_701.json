    "content": "This course attempts to impart knowledge on advanced aspects of atmospheric and space physics. Starting with the basics of inertial and non-inertial forces and various dynamical phenomenon it leads to understanding various important aspects such as atmospheric waves and instabilities. The second half of the course is devoted to the understanding of various phenomenon related to ionosphere, the coupling between solar energy and magnetosphere, single particle motion in a variety of electric and magnetic fields, formation of earth?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s radiation belts etc. This course can be an extension to the earlier NPTEL course: Introduction to atmospheric and space sciences."
