    "content": "This course would highlight the concepts and applications of widely used experimental technique of X-ray crystallography. The could would take the students through the lane of crystallographic symmetry to the structure determination and refinement of crystal structures using x-ray diffraction. Any experimental organic or inorganic chemist would be benefited from this course."
