    "content": "The goal of this course, \"Corrosion/ Environmental Degradation/Surface Engineering,\" is to give students a thorough understanding of the science and engineering of surface degradation, with a primary focus on corrosion and environmental degradation of materials. It also teaches students how to use surface engineering to mitigate these processes. The principles of surface degradation mechanisms, control and preventive strategies, and the effects of environmental conditions on material deterioration are covered. The course will also look at different surface engineering methods that can improve the performance and longevity of materials in challenging settings, like coatings and surface modification. Understanding how material qualities, environmental conditions, and degradation mechanisms interact will be emphasised, as well as how to use this information in practical situations."
