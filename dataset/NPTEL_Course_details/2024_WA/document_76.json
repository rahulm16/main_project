    "content": "This course attempts to provide an introduction to the different commonly-used medical imaging systems. Although there are several courses and textbooks available from medical physics background, there are only few materials that treat the subject from a system?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s perspective, which is the view point taken here. This course will be thought at a level where the students from different engineering branches may find it useful. After the initial introduction and review modules, the different modalities can be taken as a stand-alone-module, and for each the physics, instrumentation, reconstruction and Image quality will be discussed."
