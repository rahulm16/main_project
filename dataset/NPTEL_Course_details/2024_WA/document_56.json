    "content": "This course deals with automated analysis of diagnostic medical images, namely X-rays, CT and MRI scans. We will start with some basic material on how to visualize medical images and how to interpret the resolution of medical images correctly in addition to standard techniques for image processing. In successive weeks we will examine often used and powerful algorithms for image segmentation and image registration. We will then look at how these automated methods can be used to enable computer aided diagnosis. In the final 2 weeks, we will discuss deep learning for medial image analysis , especially state of the art 3D convolutional neural networks."
