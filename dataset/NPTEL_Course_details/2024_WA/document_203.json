Specifically, it will take learners through different aspects of understanding, creating and evaluating software conceptual designs. After going through the course, learners will be able to: 1. Think of software in terms of sub-systems, and understand what issues have to be considered in order to design these sub-systems 2. Create a software conceptual design for a given design problem, and model them using Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams 3. Evaluate their designs for functional and non-functional quality attributes"
