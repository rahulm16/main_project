    "content": "Competition Law and Intellectual Property Law prima facie appear to have conflicting objectives and goals. While Competition law operates towards facilitating the market growth by curbing anti-competitive practices in the market, IPRs confer exclusive monopoly to the proprietor. However, both are intended towards promoting innovation and consumer welfare. In the ever evolving technology driven society, the recent conflict between the domain of IPRs and completion law pertains to the exercise of rights in IPR affecting competition law. Therefore, in the light of the above intricacies and problems the course aims to discuss the general principles and laws related to Intellectual Property Right and Competition law, The course also provides an overview of the application and operation of both the laws in different jurisdictions and tries to simplify the overlapping domain of IP and Competition Law."
