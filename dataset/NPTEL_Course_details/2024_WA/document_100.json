    "content": "Solid-Fluid Operations is a term used to refer to the science and technology related to the handling and processing of particles and powders is presence and absence of fluid. Particle technology is also often described as powder technology, particle science and powder science. Powders and particles are commonly referred to as bulk solids, particulate solids and granular solids. The objective of this course is to introduce the subject of particle technology to students studying degree courses in disciplines requiring knowledge of the processing and handling of particles and powders. Although the primary target readership is amongst students of chemical engineering, the material included should form the basis of courses on particle technology for students studying other disciplines including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, applied chemistry, pharmaceutics, metallurgy and minerals engineering."
