    "content": "The Environmental Biotechnology course aims to introduce and elaborate the fundamental concepts and applications of biotechnology in all aspects of environment including its protection, restoration and sustainability. Considering the rising challenges of climate change, energy and environmental crisis, this course will emphasize upon the recent development of biotechnology for harnessing microbial potential in environmental applications. The course is structured to provide the students with fundamental concepts of environmental biotechnology, highlighting the importance of microbial ecology, their metabolism, methods for their characterization and scopes for implementation. Bioremediation and biodegradation principles, processes and applications will be discussed along with advanced applications in wastewater, oil recovery, biohydrometallurgy, biofuel, carbon storage and capture, etc. This course will offer the students a broad sense of understanding on how modern biotechnology is developed to achieve better environmental protection and sustainability through the use of microbes and microbial communities in pollution abatement to mitigation of climate change, bioenergy, biomaterial to enzyme discovery. ."
