    "content": "This course titled ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faInternational Studies in Vernacular Architecture?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 was originally conceived as a Master?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s program by late Professor Paul Oliver in 1997 at Oxford Brookes University. It grew out of the work he completed as editor of the seminal 3 volume Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World published by Cambridge University Press, published in 1997. Taking the view of growing concerns on ways to study and teach World?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s Vernacular traditions in Architecture education, this proposed course is an effort from the ISVA Alumni who are now in academia or architectural practice throughout the globe, wish to revitalize this field of teaching and learning. The content and structure of the original course is unique and we feel the course offers urgent and relevant approaches to the many challenges we face, from climate change to housing crises. By re-examining the subjects covered in the curriculum the next generation of students will be equipped with the vital knowledge and understanding of vernacular traditions of the world. The proposed course can be considered as elective subject by schools imparting architectural education, sociology, anthropology, and cultural geography."
