    "content": "This is a course on language documentation, a sub-field of linguistics. The growing global recognition of indigenous knowledge systems has brought an urge to document the dying languages. There are different projects going on all over the world including India where scholars from different fields are working together to save and document the dying languages. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to the issues related to language endangerment and various aspects of language documentation focused on the Indian scenario. The course along with making the students aware of the theories related to language documentation will also train them in data collection, data processing and creating various applications with the available data."
