    "content": "Molecular rearrangements in organic synthesis involve the transformation of the structure of a molecule by the movement of atoms or groups of atoms within the molecule. These rearrangements play a crucial role in the synthesis of organic compounds, allowing chemists to create complex structures from simpler starting materials. Molecular rearrangements can be classified into various types, and they are often named based on the specific changes occurring in the molecule such as 1,2-metallate rearrangement, Cope Rearrangement, Claisen Rearrangement, Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement, Pinacol Rearrangement, Beckmann Rearrangement, Fries Rearrangement, Baeyer-Villiger Oxidation and so on. This is aprivileged tool towards chemists and biochemists providing access to control the structure-reactivity relationship."
