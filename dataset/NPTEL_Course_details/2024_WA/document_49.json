    "content": "Neurobiology is the fascinating field that explores the organization and the functioning of the brain. This course will provide an introduction to the field of neurobiology/neuroscience. We will learn about how individual neurons in the brain function, how they generate electrical activity, how neurons communicate with one another, and how they organize into circuits that enable complex abilities such as sensory perception. The course will also be useful for students who are interested in neural networks or artificial intelligence to draw inspiration from the biological neural networks. The course can be taken by students irrespective of whether they have prior exposure to the field of biology."
