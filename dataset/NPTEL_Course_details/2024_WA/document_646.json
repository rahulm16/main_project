    "content": "The world is passing through revolutionary shift in the field of energy generation and utilization as sustainability problems related to pollution and climate change force a shift from traditional fossil fuel based energy to renewable and carbon neutral sources of energy. This course attempts to provide a synoptic overview of the rapidly developing ecosystem of sustainable energy technologies that are being developed and deployed to exploit the various carbon neutral energy resources, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of current energy systems and to develop a more flexible energy grid and energy storage system for the future. India is expected to remain as one of the largest producers and consumers of energy in this coming decades and challenges and opportunities for the Indian energy ecosystem will also be highlighted. While the course will not delve deep into any one technology, the course will provide a broad description of each of the technologies and their associated basic theoretical and analytical underpinnings."
