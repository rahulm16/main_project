    "content": "The reactor design and chemical kinetics are the key elements of synthesizing almost all industrial chemicals. The types of reactor (ideal/non-ideal), choosing a catalyst, product (desired) formation rate, by-product formation, catalyst deactivation and other parameters are also important aspects for an industrial reactor operation. This course is intended to improve the basic knowledge of final-year undergraduate and graduate-level (PG) students in Chemical Engineering. The course's primary objective is to enable the students to understand the analysis of various reactors that used in chemical industry. The course will reinforce understanding of the basic concept and principles of various industrial problems associated with reaction engineering. He is teaching the course (CHE-505 Advanced Reaction Engineering, CHN-505 Chemical Reactor Analysis, CH-427 Heterogeneous Catalysis and Reactor Design) since 2015."
