    "content": "This course is a design oriented course aimed at photovoltaic system design. The course begins by discussing about the PV cell electrical characteristics and interconnections. Estimation of insolation and PV sizing is addressed is some detail. Maximum power point tracking and circuits related to it are discussed. Later, applications related to peltier refrigeration, water pumping, grid connection and micro grids are discussed in detail. Lastly a brief discussion on life cycle costing is also discussed in order to bring in a measure of completeness to the course."
