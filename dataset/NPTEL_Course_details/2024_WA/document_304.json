    "content": "Digital image processing deals with processing of images which are digital in nature. Study of the subject is motivated by three major applications. The first application is in improvement of pictorial information for human perception i.e. enhancing the quality of the image so that the image will have a better look. The second is for autonomous machine applications which have wider applications in industries, particularly for quality control in assembly automation and many similar applications. Another major application area is in efficient storage and transmission of images. This course will introduce various image processing techniques, algorithms and their applications."
