    "content": "This course will provide an overview on mass transfer at basic to an intermediate level. This course applies the concepts of diffusion and interphase mass transfer to the analysis of different unit operations such as humidification, drying, adsorption, extraction, leaching, crystallization and membrane processes. The course synthesizes fundamental concepts and analytical skills to understand mass transfer operations and to tackle the sort of complex problems. Information on key topics will be provided in the form of summary of lecture notes, problems and adequate references."
