    "content": "As climate change and associated climate mitigation and adaptation strategies become an increasingly important concern for the government, the industry as well as multiple disciplines within the academia, there is need for a course that provides a physics-based understanding of the parameters controlling climatic variability and human influence on climate variability to UG/PG students from diverse science/technology backgrounds. A basic grounding on instruments and methodologies to monitor climate relevant variables will also prove useful and interesting to students of engineering disciplines. Such a course will also prove beneficial to industry professionals who are interested in developing technology/policy/business solutions for climate change.\n\nThis course will provide the participant with a thorough introductory grounding of climate physics, climatic patterns of variability, and the human influences in the ongoing climate change. In addition, the participant will also gain an understanding of how various climatological and meteorological variables are measured using ground based, upper air and satellite based instrumentation. The course will also be very useful for those who wish to specialize further in climatological modelling, satellite based observation of weather and climate etc."
