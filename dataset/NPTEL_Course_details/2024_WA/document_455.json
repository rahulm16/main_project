    "content": "The overarching reform in the Electricity sector culminated into the enactment of a new law in the year 2003. After repealing related laws, the Electricity Act, 2003 ushered a new era of reform in the sector by opening up the market for the private players and creating an autonomous regulatory body which has been entrusted with the responsibility to promote the sector and bring in efficiency by furthering the interest of the consumer. It has also established a specialized tribunal to adjudicate the disputes related to the electricity sector. The law introduced multi-buyer model in place of single-buyer model to increase competitiveness amongst the stakeholders. Beside the discussion on the above mentioned areas, the course will highlight the issues of renewables and related provisions in the law."
