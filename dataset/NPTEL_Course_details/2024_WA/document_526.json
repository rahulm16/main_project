    "content": "This course provides a generalized framework to understanding various material properties (concentrating on electronic, electromechanical and optical properties). First, we discuss how material symmetry dictates the existence of properties, by understanding in depth what symmetry is, and how properties as tensors correlate to symmetry.\n\nNext, we look at equilibrium properties, their origin from the purview of thermodynamics and a bit of statistical mechanics. Then we look at dissipative properties as analogues of friction coefficient, through Onsagers formulation.\n\nWe then look at properties as response functions and understand the relationship between equilibrium and dissipative properties (dielectric constant and conductivity for e.g.). We end by understanding how to measure these properties through various absorption and scattering spectroscopic tools starting from neV processes (transport measurements) to 10s of keV processes (x-ray based techniques).\n\nBy the end of the course, the student will learn and appreciate the necessary ingredients required to start the design of materials for desired functions."
