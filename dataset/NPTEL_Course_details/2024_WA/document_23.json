    "content": "This course offers an overview of Product Lifecycle technologies and Carbon Capture and Storage. This content is designed for a wide-ranging audience with a keen interest in energy, sustainability, and climate change. The objective is to identify carbon-negative solutions, therefore achieving a state of carbon balance in the 21st century. Carbon Capture and Storage guarantees the security and feasibility of affordable and easily obtainable fossil fuels while adhering to the guidelines set forth in the 2015 Paris Climate Change agreement. The first part of the course talks about the emission of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by firmly and permanently sequestering it beneath. This course acts as a bridge between the latest breakthroughs in science, engineering, geology, policy, and economics and the wider public. A practical approach in designing, developing, and running the DSS models in order to track, store and account the Carbon is presented. A working prototype is demonstrated for the better understanding of the students. The aim is to encourage further exploration of possible strategies to alleviate climate change."
