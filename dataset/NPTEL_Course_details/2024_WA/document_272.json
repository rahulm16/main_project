    "content": "In a way, this course is very similar to Introduction to Economics. Two major differences are: 1. The language of the instruction is largely Hindi. The technical terms and the definition should be stated in English. The hindi translation of the definition should also be provided 2. In order to make this course accessible to more people, the use of Calculus would be avoided. Microeconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among individuals. Economic theories are based on the assumption that individuals as well as firms have well defined objectives; utility maximization for individuals and profit maximization for firms and they act systematically according to the incentives and constraints of their economic environment. It is this framework that allows the economist to gain a fundamental understanding of the human puzzle in an economic setting. This course in the fundamentals of economics covers consumer theory, producer theory as well as the market structures through which individuals and firms interact."
