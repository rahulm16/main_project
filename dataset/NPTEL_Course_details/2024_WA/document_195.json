    "content": "It is an intensive course covering material aspects of concrete, specifications, analysis, and design of reinforced concrete (RC) components using the limit state method. The focus will be given to the background and mechanics of the code provisions and their limitations. Particularly, the students will learn advanced topics related to the behaviour and design of reinforced concrete. The advanced topics include flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete, the behaviour and design of slender columns, two-way slab systems, strut and tie modelling for the design of structural components, frame joints, torsion, and walls. Special topics will also include the design of shear walls, curved beams, moment redistribution in continuous beams; bond and development length, and curtailment of reinforcing steel. Finally, a design project will be given to bridge the theory and practice."
