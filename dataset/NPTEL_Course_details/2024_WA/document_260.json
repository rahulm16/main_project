    "content": "This is an introductory course on Machine Learning (ML) that is offered to undergraduate and graduate students. The contents are designed to cover both theoretical and practical aspects of several well-established ML techniques. The assignments will contain theory and programming questions that help strengthen the theoretical foundations as well as learn how to engineer ML solutions to work on simulated and publicly available real datasets. The project(s) will require students to develop a complete Machine Learning solution requiring preprocessing, design of the classifier/regressor, training and validation, testing, and evaluation with quantitative performance comparisons. Each week?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s theory contents will be accompanied with a tutorial on python."
