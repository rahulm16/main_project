    "content": "Around 75 percentage of chemical manufacturingAround 75% of chemical manufacturing processes involve small solid particles at some point. Proper design and handling of these fine particles often makes the difference between success and failure of the product. Many products such as catalysts, pigments, fertilizers, cements, ceramics and pharmaceuticals are currently manufactured in particulate forms. Mechanical Operations deal with Science and Technology of particulate matter, which is a multidisciplinary field including Materials Science, Environmental, Biomedical, Aerospace, Agricultural, Chemistry, Microbiology and Cell Science, Pharmacy and Medicine. The primary objective of this course is to\nidentify the important physical mechanisms occurring in processes involving particles\ndiscuss unit operation and its role in Chemical industries, characteristics of particulate solids, Principles of size reduction, particle dynamics and separation of particles\nformulate and solve mathematical descriptions of such processes"
