    "content": "Bridges constitute a significant portion of the national economy of a country and serve as a foundation for infrastructure development. With several new bridges required to be constructed and numerous existing bridges required to be repaired and retrofitted across the world, it is essential to study a course on ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecBridge Engineering?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9. This course on ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecBridge Engineering?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9 aims at knowledge development of principles of engineering mechanics, load transfer mechanisms, analysis methodologies, design principles, damage mechanics, failure mechanisms, construction, inspection, maintenance, repair and retrofit strategies in the realm of bridge engineering. Additionally, advanced topics in the domain of bridge engineering, like, fatigue and fracture in bridges, use of shape memory alloys (SMA) and special concrete for repair of bridges, 3D printing of bridges, high speed railway bridges, will also be introduced in this course. After successful completion of this course, the students will be able to equip themselves with fundamental concepts, acquire an in-depth knowledge on analysis and design of a wide variety of bridges, understand field-based construction, inspection, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation techniques of bridges and comprehend the emerging global trends in the domain of bridge engineering."
