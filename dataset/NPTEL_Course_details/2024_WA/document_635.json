    "content": "Biomechanics is a subject that seeks to understand the mechanics of living system. This subject helps to understand the relationship between structure and function of human joints, predict changes due to alterations, and propose methods of artificial interventions. This course is designed for B.Tech/M.Tech/PhD students who are likely to be benefited by learning the fundamental concepts of Biomechanics joint kinetics and kinematics, tissue mechanics, implants design and analysis, as well as state-of-the-art techniques of modelling and simulation of biomechanical systems."
