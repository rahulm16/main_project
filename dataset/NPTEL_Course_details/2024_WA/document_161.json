    "content": "Introduction to Engineering Seismology is general course for anyone interested to know about earthquake. Initial part of study discusses about different seismic hazard, global seismicity and risk. Further gives theory behind earthquake, plate tectonics and seismic courses and fault. Theory of wave propagation and different types of earthquakes can also discuss in the course. Couse also covers quantification of earthquake size: Concept of Intensity and Magnitude; different earthquake scales. Seismic instruments, earthquake data and interpretation of seismic data. Source mechanism and simple source model differ predictive equations in seismology and Seismic hazard estimation with examples. Taking this course will help to understand earthquake hazard and know seismic optional of the region and better way of estimating the future seismic hazard."
