    "content": "This course provide a generalized understanding to the polymer process engineering. First, a brief introduction about several polymers, their classification, and characterization techniques is provided. Then, the deep insight on the thermodynamic, rheological, heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction engineering perspective of the polymers is explained. Finally, the student will get to learn about the polymer processing, preparation processes, and industrial testing methods. To better understand the engineering perspective, the application of polymers in electronic sectors and building engineering is also discussed with examples."
