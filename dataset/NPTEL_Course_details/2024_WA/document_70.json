    "content": "Mathematical modeling has become integral part of different fields of biology, from ecology to cell biology. This course is intended to introduce students of biology to elementary mathematical concepts and tools for dynamical models. The course will focus on modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We will start with basic mathematical concepts of ODE-based models and then connect those with experimental biology. Mathematical models will be on cellular and molecular processes in biology, like cell signaling, and transcriptional networks. Students will learn basics of analytical techniques, graphical techniques, and numerical simulation."
