    "content": "This course is designed for UG & PG students, research scholars and young scientists to introduce them to basics and applications of genome editing and engineering. The course starts with understanding of basic organization and structure of genome. It gives a brief overview on different DNA strand breaks and their repair mechanism. It introduces learners to theoretical basics of genetic engineering and discusses it?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s limitations in tackling genetic problems of animals and plants. The key concepts of Genome editing are discussed thoroughly with emphasis on the major genome editing tools ZFN, TALEN and CRISP/Cas9. It discusses the biochemical basis of development of the genome editing tools, their design and their applications in various genetic conditions. It also discusses the scope and prospect of using these technologies in solving major genetic disease of human. The learners will also be acquainted with the ethical concerns associated with applications of genome editing and engineering in germline."
