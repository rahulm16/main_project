    "content": "The purpose of this course is to introduce learners from different disciplines and backgrounds to the fundamental concepts, process and practice of ethnography. The course will offer an introduction to various tools and methods that form ethnographic practice. This is underpinned by an introduction to the concepts, theories and debates that form the theoretical basis of ethnographic research. While the course will be structured in the forms of video lectures, readings and exercises, we hope to design each of these to give the learner as much practice based learning as possible. This also makes the course relevant to practicioners. In this way, we hope, the course will aid the learner in honing their existing knowledge of the subject with a view to improve their practice and application of it. Alternately, it will offer an opportunity for new learners to enter into practice supported by an expansive understanding of the subject."
