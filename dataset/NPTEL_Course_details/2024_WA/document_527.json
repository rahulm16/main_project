    "content": "The present course will deal with the nanomaterials and their unique properties. The nanomaterials are ubiquitous in various fields of science and engineering. Almost, every field uses nanomaterials in research as well as applications. Hence, it is important to know the basic concepts related to properties of nanomaterials. The course will also deliberate on the structure, surface energy of nanomaterials and their correlation with properties. The unique properties of nanomaterials will be connected with structure (atomic, microstructure at nanoscale) and connected to basic concepts."
