    "content": "Economics of Health and Education will introduce students to the microeconomic foundations of health and education as economic goods. This course will lay emphasis on theory and practice. The focus of this course will be on the developing countries experience with particular reference to India. We will draw knowledge from the larger literature on human capital and human development and understand the linkages and implications. To be able to carry out empirical analyses as an outcome of this course, students will also learn about the current health and education policy of India as well as the most used databases. General lectures on public health and education in India are planned to introduce students to the debates in this field. All candidates interested in understanding the health and education sectors of developing countries such as India are encouraged to enroll."
