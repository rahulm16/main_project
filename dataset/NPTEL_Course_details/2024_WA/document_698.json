    "content": "Why do we do what we do? There are many reasons for arriving at a choice - moral/values/ethics are one of them. Moral thinking is when we examine our value premises that constitute our decision making process. Moral thinking takes place implicitly or explicitly. This course on ethics aims to spark the student into sustained thinking about ethical issues and the tools needed for it - the concepts and broad theories of ethics. The course would be loaded with examples - real life and imaginary, to bring out the connection between the world of values and the day to day lived experience"
