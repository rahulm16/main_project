    "content": "This course is an introduction to one of the most dominant schools of thought in the Humanities and Social Sciences today, with visible impact on computer sciences, legal studies and other disciplines. It examines the origins, key concepts and the central tenets of the school, while drawing from literary texts and, where necessary, popular genres like cinema and comics. It explores the philosophical consequences of a posthumanist vision, especially in terms of robot-ethics, care and the Anthropocene."
