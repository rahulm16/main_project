    "content": "Though the course primarily targets students of civil engineering in colleges, other engineering students may also find it interesting. The course seeks to present a rounded view of the divers issues involved in the management of construction projects, and includes aspects like construction economics, quality and safety management, and contract management, apart from time management and scheduling, estimation. It is hoped that engineers working in contracting, consulting and other organizations related to construction projects will also find the course useful."
