    "content": "Patent specifications - the documents which encompass the patent right in a technological invention are techno-legal documents created at the interface of science and law. Unlike technical writing, patent law requires drafting patent specifications to satisfy certain requirements. This course is designed to enable beginners without any prior knowledge on patent drafting to draft patent specifications on their own. The course will cover the fundamental principles of patent drafting and discuss in detail the concepts in patent law in the context of patent drafting."
