    "content": "Water scarcity and inefficient water resource management technologies are the main challenges in developing countries like India. India has only 4% of the World's freshwater resources, out of which 85 % of water is used for agriculture. Irrigation is the backbone of agriculture, and the efficient utilisation of irrigation water is possible only by the adoption of highly efficient irrigation methods, such as micro irrigation. Micro-irrigation provides water to plant(s) in precise amount, at right time and at appropriate place."
