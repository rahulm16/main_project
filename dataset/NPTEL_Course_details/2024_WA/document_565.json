    "content": "Representation theory has many applications in both mathematics and theoretical physics. The course will introduce representation theory via studying the finite dimensional representations of general Linear Lie algebra (gl_n). We prove all finite dimensional representations of gl_n is completely reducible. We develop Verma\u2019s highest weight theory using the root space decomposition of gl_n, and using this we classify all finite dimensional irreducible representations of gl_n. Finally, we end with Weyl Character formula and some of its applications."
