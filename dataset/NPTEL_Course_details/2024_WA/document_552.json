It also covers theoretical concepts of probability and stochastic processes pertaining to handling various stochastic modeling. This course provides random variable, distributions, moments, modes of convergences, classification and properties of stochastic processes, stationary processes, discrete and continuous time Markov chains and simple Markovian queueing models."
