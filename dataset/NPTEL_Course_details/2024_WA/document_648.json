    "content": "The course will cover the basics of mechanics of deformable solids undergoing small deformations. The syllabus includes: Concepts of state of stress, strain and stress-strain and stress-strain-temperature relations. Exposure to experimental evaluation of stresses by photoelasticity and strain gauges. Stresses developed in torsion, bending, and shear-stresses in bending for slender members. Exposure to unsymmetrical bending and shear center. Bending deflection by various methods with particular emphasis to method of superposition. Stability of columns. Concepts of stress concentration, stress intensification and theories of failures. Extensive use of animations with supportive experimental results will be the unique feature of the course"
