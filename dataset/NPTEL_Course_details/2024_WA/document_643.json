    "content": "The progress of material processing is ever challenging with the development of new materials and their application in modern technologies. Materials processing effectively transforms the raw materials into useful products and largely decides the thermal, electrical, mechanical and other characteristic properties. The specific properties of materials, useful coating, thin film deposition, and integration of fibers mainly bring the functional properties of modern optical, electronic, and biomedical devices. Material processing technologies are mainly explained by heat transfer and material flow, diffusion, phase transformation and solidification that bridge the gap between manufacturing science and engineering. The syllabus is oriented to the conventional and advancement of the material processing technologies. The modules cover almost all the direction of material processing technologies and it is blended with fundamental development to the recent technologies. Audience will be able to develop fundamental understanding on different perspective and recent development in this field through the lectures and reinforce their knowledge by solving assignments. This course is presented in a lucid and simplified way to make it enjoyable to the beginners."
