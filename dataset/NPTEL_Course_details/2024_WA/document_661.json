    "content": "Surface mining is the most popular mining technology. However, it is being challenged due to dearth of near surface deposits and socio-environmental constraints. With the invention of large scale equipment, innovative technologies and strategic planning surface mining can be carried out at a larger depth also with profit. Basic knowledge of surface mining is thus important for the mining engineers. This course is thus designed to provide the basic surface mining technology to the students."
