    "content": "This course addresses anyone who is interested in change, not the temporary change, but transformation at a deeper, sustained level; whether individual or collective. The course is structured to provide a basic knowledge of Psychology and Neuroscience before using a narrative biography of Mahatma Gandhi to elucidate the process of transformation. It does not look at Mahatma Gandhi?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s politics rather at the Man who left behind a model of transformation. We posit it in a scientific analysis here."
