    "content": "The subject STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY deals with the shape (geometry), displacements (kinematics/strain) and forces (dynamics/stress) in Earth and Planetary bodies. In other words, the subject deals with the deformation of rocks - their architecture and development through geological time scales.Deformed rocks and structures conceal a series of tales, decoding of which is the challenge of a structural geologist in presenting the evolution of our planet earth. The knowledge of structural geology is applied in may practical fields e.g., hydrocarbon, mineral and groundwater explorations, construction industries, natural hazard analysis, landscape evolution etc. This course will primarily focus upon the basics and introductory level understanding of the subject."
