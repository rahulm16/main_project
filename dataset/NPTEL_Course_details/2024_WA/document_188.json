    "content": "This course is an undergraduate core course. The course will focus on the design of shallow foundation and axially loaded pile foundation. The field and laboratory soil testing methods will be discussed to determine the required design parameters. Lateral earth pressures theories and design of various retaining structures will be covered. Design of sheet piles and bracing system will also be discussed. It will also focus on soil arching and its application to design the underground conduits. The selection of proper foundation or characteristics of foundations for different soils will be discussed. The course is suitable for undergraduate students who are preparing for competitive examination like GATE, IES and for university or college examinations. Field Engineers can also be benefited from this course."
