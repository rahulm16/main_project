    "content": "In the contemporary dynamic manufacturing era, to produce products that can be easily made and can offer typical competences is of utmost importance. Besides basic manufacturing processes, engineering students and manufacturers needs to bolster their skills in advanced technologies. This course is a step in this direction to make the students to learn design, development, and manufacturing using Rapid Manufacturing technologies. Along with specific Rapid Prototyping techniques, manufacturing concerns such as geometric modelling, design for manufacturing and assembly, developing modular designs, group technology, et cetera are included. Laboratory demonstrations are also induced for practical experience. In the end of this course, students should be able to identify the methods and techniques required to manufacture any model."
