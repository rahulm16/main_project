    "content": "I will teach Experimental Physics in this course. I have designed this course in three modules: (I) Experimental Physics-I : Experiments on Mechanics, General properties of matter, Thermal properties of matter, Sound, Electricity and magnetism. (II) Experimental Physics-II : Experiments on Optics and Modern Physics. (III) Experimental Physics-III : Experiments on Solid state physics and Modern Optics.Each module is of 30 hours course and at present we will discuss only module-I. Module-II and III may be discussed in successive semester. This course is not only suitable for undergraduate students of physics, rather it is compulsory for all undergraduate students of science, engineering and technology , who have to deal with instruments in any point of time during their carrier and profession. This course will make you understand the working principle of many common devices through their applications in different experimentswith particular aims. Also this course have positive feedback for the national level examinations like GATE, NET, JAM and JEST conducted by IIT, UGC/CSIR, IIT and SERB, respectively."
