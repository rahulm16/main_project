    "content": "A product that is manufactured in a bioreactor or a fermentor, is recovered and purified in several subsequent unit operations. The economy of a manufacturing process is determined by the cost effectiveness of these downstream operations. This course discusses these operations and the basic underlying principles with worked out problems. This course will be useful for UG/PG students in biotechnology/chemical engineering as well as practicing bioprocess and chemical engineers."
