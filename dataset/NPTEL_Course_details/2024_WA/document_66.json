    "content": "Computational Neuroscience is the fundamental subject to provide quantitative understanding of information processing by neurons in the brain. Questions on, how humans and other animals learn efficiently, create and recall memories, make decisions among many others can be approached with the basic understanding of computation by neurons and its general principles. The course will include topics starting with the very basics of quantifying neuronal activity and modeling spiking by single neurons. Next the course dwells upon the general approaches used to understand representation of information by neurons and how such information may be readout for practical applications. Finally the course covers the computational modeling of implementing plasticity, the most important aspect of the brain, aiding in learning, memory and cognition."
