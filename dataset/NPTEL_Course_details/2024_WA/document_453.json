    "content": "Protecting biological diversity has traditionally been associated with the lives and cultures of communities living in any specified region. More than half of the world?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s medicines are derived from plants and as such humans have used biodiversity for many purposes. There has been tremendous overexploitation of genetic resources by industries etc., leading to their reduction and associated effects on the environment and the human life. Following the formation of WTO as well as introduction of TRIPS, biodiversity representing ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faknowledge?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 has received a new definition under intellectual property. Initial discussions at the Earth summit at Rio culminating in the Convention on Biodiversity has led to the realization of greater protection of genetic resources and the need for access as well as benefit sharing. Biodiversity Governance is directly connected to the sustenance of all major industry sectors, livelihood of rural population and the survival of mankind. The international, regional and domestic laws in this area have undergone significant transition in the last two decades. As a well-crafted topic equally balanced between its theoretical and practical realms, this course intends not only to create an awareness and knowledgebase about the regime of biodiversity protection, but also to enlighten the learner about the scope and ambit in pursuing one?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s career options in the same spectrum. This course aims at touching base on the essential areas of compliance with domestic and global Biodiversity Governance Regulations, regulatory and approval mechanisms operating in this area, and the procedure and practice nuances which can help in crafting a career in compliance practice"
