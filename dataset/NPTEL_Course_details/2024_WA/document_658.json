    "content": "Phase constitution and the dispersion of various phases in solids decisively influence the properties of materials. Size, size distribution of various phases in solids can be tailored by understanding and optimizing the solid state phase transformations in solids. Phase transformation can be influenced by coupling the heat treatment either by introduction of mechanical energy into solids or by altering the chemistry of solids. Accordingly several Thermo Mechanical and Thermo Chemical processes treatments have been developed by the researchers. This course is designed to provide the fundamental science behind these processes so that optimal utilization of these processes is possible. Course will cover the utilization of flow stress data from hot deformation experiments to develop constitutive equations and processing maps, the interrelationship between microstructure and deformation features with the thermo-mechanical deformation processes. Important thermo chemical processes such as nitriding, carburizing, carbonitriding, nitrocarburizing and boriding will be covered."
