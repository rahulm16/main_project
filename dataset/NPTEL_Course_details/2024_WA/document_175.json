    "content": "The problems affiliated with solid waste management (SWM) in today's sprawling civilized and urbanized society are intricate because of the quantity and varied nature of wastes, the funding restriction for public disposal, interference of technology (energy and raw materials), and complex infrastructure development network in urban cities. As a result, if SWM is to achieve in consummate approach, the fundamentals aspects need to be identified. Thus, there is dire need to group the activities from the generation to the disposal point. The six different functional elements (generation, handing and separations, storage and processing at source, collection, the transformation of wastes, transfer and transport, and final disposal) for the engineering comparison and treatment need to be understood in detail. The understanding of the functional element is important because it helps in evaluating the impacts of projected changes and technological developments. Solid waste management is an essential part of every society, but it is also one of the most neglected one. An in-depth understanding of the subject is required to tackle the current solid waste management crisis effectively. This course attempts to familiarize various steps involved in solid waste management."
