    "content": "The aim of this course is to introduce the concept of plate tectonics and its relevance to the students. The geodynamics of plate movement, its affect on various segments of the earth is less understood yet. The application part of the course is mainly confined in the concept of mineral and hydrocarbon exploration, paleogeographic changes, sedimentary basin development and closure, climate changes and understanding the seismic nature of the active segments of the plate boundary zones. A special segment in this course is neotectonics meant for application of tectonics in understanding the recent plate movement and its effect on our daily life."
