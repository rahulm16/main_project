    "content": "Geological Fieldwork is considered as an important part of a geologist?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s training and a modern geologist must have a strong understanding of the features offered by the rock-exposures. The fieldwork program emphasizes techniques and provides training in the field interpretation of structural geology and tectonics, geopmorphology, stratigraphy, sedimentology, and igneous processes. This course will cover and provide basic understandings on different structural features observed in a typical deformed geological terrane. The content of the course has been designed largely to motivate mostly undergraduate geology students to understand the deformation processes operating in the different deformed regions by observing and interpreting different outcrop scale deformation structures in the field."
