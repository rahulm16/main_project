    "content": "The course will focus on three processes i.e. combing , roving preparation and ring spinning. The construction , design features and working principles of the machines will be looked into. The role of machine and process parameters on process performance will be explained. The interaction between technology and machine design will be discussed. Emphasis will be on ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecknow why?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9 rather than ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecknow how?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9."
