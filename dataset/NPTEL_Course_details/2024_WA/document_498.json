Big Data and current industrial revolution have the potential to optimise processes and cut down on resource consumption, which will be crucial for achieving sustainable development. The course is broken up into twelve weeks, and each week conclusion includes an exercise to test and sharpen your skills. The lectures would walk the students over the fundamental syntax and operations, as well as the key Python numerical and visualisation libraries. These skills will be put to use in hands-on activities that involve loading a dataset from the steel industry and creating algorithms for data aggregation. While understanding the concepts through case studies, the learners would be able to load, work, and visualize real-time useful data."
