    "content": "This course explores the materials science of concrete, and attempts to bring about the understanding of concrete behavior from a fundamental perspective. The first part of the course discusses the structure and properties of concrete making materials. This is followed by mixture proportioning of high performance concrete, and a study of selected topics regarding fresh and hardened concrete behavior. The final part of the course deals with long term performance issues, related to creep, shrinkage and durability of concrete"
