    "content": "This is a basic course on electric and magnetic circuits suitable for any first-year undergraduate engineering program. It covers the analysis of DC circuits, AC circuits using the phasor concept, three-phase circuits, magnetic circuits and transformer-equivalent circuits. In all the chapters, it explains the concepts lucidly, like reactive power in time and phasor domains and negative wattmeter readings in three-phase circuits. It provides a comprehensive way to solve circuit problems. Overall, the course focuses on simple methods to solve different circuit problems, including transformer as a magnetic and electric circuit."
