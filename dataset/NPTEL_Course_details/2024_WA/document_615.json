    "content": "The course presents theory of vibrations of continuous systems such as rods, plates and shells. Many engineering applications like automobiles, aircraft structures, ship hulls, submarine hulls, pipes carrying water and all such applications where high speed moving parts are used, require knowledge of this topic as high vibrations will be a problem."
