    "content": "This course is based on application of quantum mechanics to molecular systems to probe their energy levels. Prior understanding of solutions to the time-independent Schrodinger equation is assumed. The major emphasis of this course is to derive the 'Transition Moment Integral' using semi-classical approach. Further, the relationship between the transition moment integral to experimental observables such as extinction coefficient (from Beet-Lambert law) will evaluated."
