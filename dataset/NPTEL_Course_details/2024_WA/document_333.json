    "content": "This course is intended to equip any students interested in electronic materials and devices with the fundamentals of semiconductor devices. The materials covered in The course begins with fundamentals and accelerates to advanced topics in semiconductor physics. The course connects circuit performance to material and device behavior. At the end of the course, the students would learn to: 1.) Learn the important concepts related to semiconductor technology. 2.) Perform the analysis and design of semiconductor devices (electrostatics and current-voltage characteristics) from fundamental principles. 3.) Learn how to extract device parameters by suitable experiments. 4.) Engineer and innovate on device design and even construct new devices intended for special applications in circuits. There is special emphasize placed on this aspect. 5.) Learn the fundamentals of circuit design and observe how device properties and device design impact circuit behaviour (eg. dc and ac response, noise) 6.) Extend the concepts and analysis to advanced topics such as: devices based on disordered semiconductors (eg. organic semiconductors, amorphous metal oxides), flexible and printed electronics, etc."
