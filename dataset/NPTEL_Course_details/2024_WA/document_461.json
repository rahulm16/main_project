    "content": "Work is an inherent part of human behaviour. Most adults spend at least 30 percent of their life time in their work place and/or in work related activities. Like in any other context, human behaviour in the organizational and work context is a complex phenomenon. Individual behaviour at work is a result of interaction between various individual, group and organizational level factors. Understanding how individuals and groups behave at work place will not only help improve their effectiveness but also nurture the quality of work life of the individuals. This course will help students to be cognizant of these work place dynamics so that they make conscious decisions in their future work life as well as long term career."
