    "content": "Optics is used in many applications today. In fact, the field of optics has quietly gone from the research table to being used in numerous applications ranging from devices to metrology. Opto-electronics and metrology are already well-developed fields merging the areas of optics and a variety of other engineering areas (such as electronics, mechanical engineering, etc) in many advanced and commonly used devices. For an engineering student to be able to understand and design optics for such applications, it is important to understand some basic optics. This course will introduce these concepts at a level relevant for an engineer. The course will also study specific engineering examples with a detailed look at the optics of these."
