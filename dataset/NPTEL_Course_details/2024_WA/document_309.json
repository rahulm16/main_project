    "content": "Testing is an integral part of the VLSI design cycle. With the advancement in IC technology, designs are becoming more and more complex, making their testing challenging. Testing occupies 60-80% time of the design process. A well structured method for testing needs to be followed to ensure high yield and proper detection of faulty chips after manufacturing. Design for testability (DFT) is a matured domain now, and thus needs to be followed by all the VLSI designers. In this context, the course attempts to expose the students and practitioners to the most recent, yet fundamental, VLSI test principles and DFT architectures in an effort to help them design better quality products that can be reliably manufactured in large quantity."
