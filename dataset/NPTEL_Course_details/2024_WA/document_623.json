    "content": "Principle of operation of hydraulic machines and their system design is important from the perspective of their huge applications in different industries. Present course introduces the students to the fundamentals of hydraulic machines. Starting from the operational principle, students will be gradually familiarized with different concepts like velocity triangle, net head developed, finally leading to the design of their system. Important topics such as design of pumping system of two dissimilar pumps, which find practical relevance as well, will also be discussed."
