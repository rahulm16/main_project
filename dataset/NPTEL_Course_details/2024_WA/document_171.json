    "content": "In the last few decades, water demand in the globe has increased in many folds.Rivers,one of the major source of water demand for domestic,agricultural and industrial uses, are often not utilised properly for long term sustainability.Therefore, it is a challenging task for engineers for understanding water, sediment and energy transport processes in rivers in both spatial and temporal scales.This course will address how to understand and model hydro-fluvial processes and designing of advanced river intervention structures."
