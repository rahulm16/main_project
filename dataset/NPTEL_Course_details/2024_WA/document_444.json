    "content": "Similar to many other branches of applied economics, energy economics emerged with therealization that \u201a\u00c4\u00faenergy\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is a scarce resource. This course covers the economic principles that guide energy related behavior of both the producers and the consumers of energy and the policy regime that has emerged to govern it. The course has four building blocks: understanding energy as a scarce resource, various aspects of energy demand and supply with a focus to policies that are in place to promote renewable energy supply and finally, a much needed discussion on interaction between energy, environment and climate change. The course aims at broadening the vision of students while making any energy related decision as a technology developer, energy manager, entrepreneur, policy maker, researcher in future or simply for personal energy use in day to day activities."
