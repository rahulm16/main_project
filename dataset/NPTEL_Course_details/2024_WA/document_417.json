    "content": "This course aims at discussing the role of performative gender and religions in the South Asian context. It focuses on the philosophical and cultural premises of Bhakti and Sufi traditions, and studies the literary works produced by select Bhakti and Sufi poets. Through a reference to Sanskrit dramaturgy, the initial classes are devoted to understanding how spectacle, rituals and social philosophy are interspersed in the South Asian religions. As well, the course studies the cinematic adaptation and romanticization of Bhakti and Sufi codes in South Asia."
