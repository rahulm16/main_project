    "content": "This course covers the developments in a number of intensified technologies, with particular emphasis on their application in chemical processes. The course is intended to be a useful resource for practising engineers and chemists alike who are interested in applying intensified reactor and/or separator systems in chemical industries. It will provide a basic knowledge of chemical engineering principles and process intensification for chemists and engineers who may be unfamiliar with these concepts. It will be a valuable tool for chemical engineers who wish to fully apply their background in reaction and separation engineering to the design and implementation of green processing technologies based on process intensification principles. Students on undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes which cover topics on advanced reactor designs, process intensification, will gain a better understanding of the practical applications in different areas."
