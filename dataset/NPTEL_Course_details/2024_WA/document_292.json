    "content": "Nanobiophotonics is a multidisciplinary field where light-based technologies are utilized to reveal biological mechanisms, and diagnose several diseases along with finding their treatments. An essential aspect of nanobiophotonics is the study of light activated processes at the cellular and tissue level . This course introduces the fundamentals of biology, photonics and nanotechnology, and provides the most relevant and significant applications from chemistry, biology, and medicine. For example, it includes how to detect and identify novel viruses (such as the Coronavirus) ,and how to measure neuronal activity of live animals by photostimulation. This course aims to give an overview of the emerging research in the field of Nanobiophotonics and its impact on our daily life."
