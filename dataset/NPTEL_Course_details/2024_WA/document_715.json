    "content": "The course aims to introduce and work through the underlying concepts behind magnetism and superconductivity. Starting from an electron in a magnetic field, the magnetic response of a collection of atoms in a solid are all worked out. Magnetization and susceptibility in para and diamagnetic cases, their applications and excitations are discussed. Superconductivity: zero resistance, Meissner effect, perfect diamagnetism; BCS theory, energy gap, isotope effect and tunneling experiments worked out. Josephson junctions and their applications, qubits and quantum chips discussed. Novel high-TC superconductor introduced. The emphasis is on working things out from very simple physical concepts."
