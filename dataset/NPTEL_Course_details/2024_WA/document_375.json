The course offers a comprehensive analysis of key theorists such as Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber who are widely considered as the stalwarts in classical sociological theory. It explains how the theoretical concerns of these scholars laid foundation to the subsequent development of sociology as a distinct social science discipline with clear theoretical as well as methodological foundations. The course enables students to develop sociological perspective and theoretical insights through a systematic analysis of the key theorists of the discipline."
