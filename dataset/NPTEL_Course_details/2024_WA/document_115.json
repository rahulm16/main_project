    "content": "The course is designed focusing on the adsorption fundamentals and the application, both at the introductory and advanced level. Adsorption technology is an important separation technology that has wide spread applications from waste water treatment to chromatography, ion exchange, gas separation based on pressure swing adsorption (for e.g. in medical oxygen concentrators), and other surface based transfer processes. The course is related to the scientific principles involved in various industry sectors including petroleum refining, oil and gas, petrochemicals, polymers, catalyst, gas separation, energy, process design, water purification and treatment, waste treatment, etc.\nIn the recent emphasis on environmental sustainability and climate change, adsorption is important for carbon capture technologies, waste separation and recovery of value added products from waste streams."
