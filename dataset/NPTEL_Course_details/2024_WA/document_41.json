    "content": "Buildings are a major contributor to the carbon emissions in the world by virtue of the energy consumption. In order to fulfill the commitment of India to reduce the emission intensity by 33 \u2013 35% after COP26, it is important to go Carbon Neutral. The two types of energy that can be quantified across a building\u2019s life cycle are its Embodied energy and Operational energy. The carbon emissions related to these constitutes the Embodied Carbon and Operational Carbon respectively. This NPTEL course discusses Embodied energy, operational energy, embodied carbon, operational carbon, carbon footprint, LCA and the scientific principles of achieving carbon neutral buildings."
