    "content": "Information as representation of knowledge is the object of study of an emergent scientific field - Cognitive Science. Increasing applications in Human-centered design, BMI and BCI, where actors like the structural, functional and computational mechanisms of the brain are engaged, necessitates advanced knowledge and research in \u201a\u00c4\u00faCognition and its Computation\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. The proposed course will dwell on the fundamentals of Cognitive Processing in humans and will also discuss some recent challenges, discoveries and some open problems. The course will include topics on both understanding natural and developing artificial cognitive information processing systems."
