    "content": "Transparency and Access to Information, is pivotal to the functioning of a democracy. In the Information Age, access to data, reports, documents, etc are sine qua non of every Individual. This course seeks to provide a comprehensive learning on the Right to Information, dealing with its multiple facets from a constitutional perspective to be a Statutory right, and thereby its evolution as an executory right through administrative and judicial process. While the Right to Information Act 2005, being a Central legislation, allows State Governments to make Rules for its implementation. It attempts to create a practical regime for the exercise of the Fundamental Right to know and establishes a mechanism within the Government to facilitate the same, in an alternate to judicial enforcement. The Act also attempts to bring in transparency and accountability in the working of ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00fapublic authorities?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2. The interpretation of the Act has seen interesting developments, such as, which Institutions are accountable to provide information under the definition of ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faPublic Authority?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2? Whether information can be provided to non-citizens? What is the content of the ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faright to Information?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2? What kind of information is exempted? Increasingly, the Courts have been called upon to interpret various provision of this Act, hence the case law development have contributed enormously to the jurisprudence of transparency law in India. The Course will aim to trace the legal development of the RTI and compare the development of the ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faright of information?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 in comparative jurisdictions such as Sri Lanka USA and UK."
