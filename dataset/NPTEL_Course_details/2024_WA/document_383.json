    "content": "Poetics is the theory of literary forms and devices, and the term is familiar to us mainly through the Greek philosopher Aristotle?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s work of the same name. Aristotle?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s Poetics is believed to be an incomplete treatise and the work that we have with us today is a systematic attempt to define only one genre, namely the art of tragedy. The treatise explores the various aspects of the genre, providing answers to what goes into the making of a tragedy and how it evokes the right kind of aesthetic response in a spectator. This attempt to systematize the study of poetry or all forms of literary composition is not specific to Greek or western literature but can be found in all literatures worthy of the name. In the Indian literary history, the term poetics in its broadest sense was concerned with two domains of art, namely n?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac?ya (play which blended drama, music, and dance) and k?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5vya (poetry and other forms of literary composition). The factors that distinguished n?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac?ya from k?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5vya in terms of form as well as content were so discernible that Sanskrit poetics virtually got bifurcated into two streams, namely n?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac?ya?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00b6?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac??\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5stra and k?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5vya?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00b6?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac??\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5stra. The n?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac?ya?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00b6?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac??\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5stra tradition of poetics, as the term denotes, focused primarily on n?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac?ya or performance of plays on stage with the accompaniment of dance and music; these aspects were technically termed in Sanskrit as ?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00b6gika (pertaining to gestures) v?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5cika (verbal elements) ?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5h?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5rya (make-up and dress) and s?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5ttvika abhinaya (representation of emotions). K?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5vya?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00b6?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac??\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5stra, on the other hand, was exclusively concerned with the ontology of k?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5vya (poetry and literary prose). The proposed course aims to introduce the students to the eight major schools in Indian aesthetics which functioned as the foundation of these two streams of poetics, such as rasa, dhvani, vakrokti, aucitya, ala?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00b6k?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5ra, anum?\u00c9\u201a\u00c4\u00fb?\u00c7\u00ac\u00c5na, gu?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00b0a and do?\u00c9\u00ac\u00b0?\u00c7\u00ac??\u00c7\u00ac\u00a3a."
