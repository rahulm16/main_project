    "content": "Structural analysis of nanomaterials is an important part of Materials Science and Nanoscience & Nanotechnology which deals with the study of crystal structure of materials and their defects. It is a prerequisite for the understanding of properties of nanomaterials to have a detailed knowledge of the structure from the atomic/molecular (local) level to the crystal structure and to the microstructure (mesoscopic scale and defect structure). The primary goal of structural analysis of nanomaterials is aiming at both investigating the structure-property relationship and discovering new properties, in order to achieve relevant improvements in current state-of-the art materials."
