    "content": "The course will be a short primer to understand how ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faanimal cell culture technologies?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 have strengthen the bio-medical research from basic research to the modern drug discovery. Animal cell culture was first performed in the very first decade of 19th century. Since then, tremendous development has taken place in this field. The lectures will help the researcher to appreciate the developments during last hundred years and will help them to independently set up cell culture laboratories. For non-biologist, it will be an informal way to demystify the intriguing routes of biomedical research where cell culture is a very ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00fapotent tool?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2."
