    "content": "The structure and load patterns of a power distribution system are significantly different than transmission system. In addition, distribution systems are transitioning from passive to active with the adoption of distributed generation, storage, and smart-grid technologies. Therefore, the analysis tools developed for a transmission system will not be directly applicable to a distribution network. This course shall introduce the modeling of the components (feeders, distribution transformer, regulators, capacitors, loads, distributed generation, storage, etc.) and analysis methods (load flow, short-circuit, etc.), specially developed for the distribution system."
