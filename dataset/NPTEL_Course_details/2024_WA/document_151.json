    "content": "The course will focus on the design of geotechnical structures under earthquake condition. The determination of the soil properties by field and laboratory tests for seismic design of geotechnical structures will also be discussed. Soil liquefaction and soil improvement techniques for remediation of seismic hazards like liquefaction will be discussed. In the undergraduate core courses, these topics are either not covered or discussed in simplified form. In the proposed course, these topics will be discussed in detail. This course is useful for both UG and PG student. Field Engineers can be benefited from this course as the design of geotechnical structures under seismic condition (those are not generally covered in UG core foundation engineering course) will be discussed here."
