    "content": "The course provides an in-depth understanding of top-down device fabrication. Focus is the unit processes typically used in micro & nanofabrication of devices. Both concepts and practical aspects are covered. Topics include crystal growth, doping, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, photolithography, wet etching, dry etching, and packaging. The course is accessible to students from diverse backgrounds, such as materials, physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. The course will be a derivative of NE203: Advanced Micro & Nano Fabrication Technology & Processes. This is a 3:0 credit course that is being successfully offered by CeNSE, IISc since 2015. The average class size is 60-70. Students from various departments outside CeNSE, e.g. Physics, Chemistry, ECE, DESE, IAP, routinely take the course. We even get some registration from JNCASR and RRI."
