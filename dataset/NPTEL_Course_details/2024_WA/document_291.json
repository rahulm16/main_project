    "content": "Adaptive filters play a very significant role in most of today?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s signal processing, communication and control applications. Their ability to process data under conditions not predictable a priori make them very useful in a diverse array of applications like radar, sonar, wireless communications, speech and audio processing, instrumentation, exploration geophysics etc. The topic of adaptive filters is very closely related to neural networks and machine learning. While a full course on adaptive filters is very involved and needs concepts from linear algebra, probability and random variables, for this particular treatment, care has been taken to maintain a minimum prerequisite requirement. Mathematical concepts necessary will be developed as part of the course. The main purpose will be to provide the participants an introduction to the subject and to prepare them for taking further studies in this and related subjects."
