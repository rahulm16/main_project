    "content": "The course on Pavement Materials will deal with the basic and fundamental understanding about the behavior of various materials used in the construction of pavements. Characterization, tests and engineering properties of these materials will be elaborated in context with its field application. Current practices and future trends in the area of pavement materials will be discussed. It is envisaged that this course will help in training students/engineers/faculty members in the domain of material engineering related to pavement application."
