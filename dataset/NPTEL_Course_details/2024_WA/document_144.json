    "content": "This course on Chemistry of Transition Metals focuses mainly on coordination chemistry, classification of ligands with special emphasis on structure and bonding concepts. 18 Electron rule and its importance in coordination and organometallic compounds. Reactions such as oxidative addition and reductive elimination, important in catalysis, are discussed in detail. Metal-ligand and metal-metal multiple bonding, trans effect in square planar complexes are also included in the discussion."
