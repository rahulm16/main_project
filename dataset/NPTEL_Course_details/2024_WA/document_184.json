    "content": "Broadly Geotechnical Engineering encompasses two distinct segments: Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering. Soil Mechanics deals with study of physical properties of soils, and the relevance of these properties as they affect soil strength, stability, and drainage. Foundation engineering deals with (i) selection of foundation type based on building site conditions and site constraints, (ii) determining size and reinforcement of the foundation and (iii) finally construction of foundation element. This course will focus on the first, soil mechanics. Soil Mechanics is the basis for all geotechnical applications.. One has to learn basic principle of geotechnical engineering through soil mechanics and it is a core course for civil engineering in every college/university across the globe. Every aspect of soil mechanics starting from origin of soil to stability of soil slopes will be covered with great detail under this course."
