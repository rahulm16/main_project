    "content": "Energy conversion technology is concerned with the transformations of energy from forms provided by nature to convenient or useful forms of energy. Harnessing the energy through these sources using efficient technologies is expected to play an important role in serving as clean energy source for mankind. This course covers fundamentals of such energy conversion systems with a broad perspective that encompasses technical and environmental aspects. The topic covers analysis of energy conversion in thermochemical, biochemical, and chemical processes using range of traditional and alternative energy sources and presents assessments of their availability, sustainability, and evaluation of their potential role in solving the global energy crisis. This course aims at providing the recent advancement and technological developments (carbonization, torrefaction, sub and supercritical water gasification, thermochemical conversion to ethanol, green diesel) in the field of conventional (coal) and non-conventional energy sources (biomass) with emphasis on engineering and design aspects and concept of integration of energy system. This course has been especially prepared for researchers, academician, professionals from industries and students to learn the important aspects of environmental friendly energy conversion technologies to produce fuels and chemicals."
