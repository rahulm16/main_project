    "content": "This course is to be prepared to serve as an introductory course for power system protection and switchgear for under graduate and post graduate students of various technical universities. It aims to give a comprehensive up-to-date presentation of the role of protection safety system, switchgears and its advances in modern power system. It begins with a state-of-the-art survey of theories and methods of protection and switchgear. In continuation, it provides a theoretical summary along with examples of real-life engineering applications to a variety of technical problems. In this point of view, the said course bridges the gap between the theoretical advances, experimental validations and practical engineering in real life"
