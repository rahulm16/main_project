    "content": "This course puts forward an invested and interdisciplinary way of examining, analysing and appreciating Indian textiles drawing on the ongoing scholarly discussions around craft-art interface, visual and contextual analysis of art practices and sustainability. A selected set of textiles and allied craft and art practices from the early modern to the contemporary period in the Indian subcontinent is addressed in this course. By situating textiles within the larger spectrum of artisanal and art practices in given temporal settings, this course emphasises interconnections between makers, communities, processes, objects and consumers. This approach is beneficial for art practitioners, designers, aspiring art historians, and those preparing for competitive examinations. Studies in Indian textiles have underscored a range of pertinent topics, including textiles and trade networks (Barnes 1997, 2017; Crill 2006, 2008; Peck 2013), materials and techniques of textile making (Bean 1989; Cecil 2013; Cohen 2016), textiles and identity formation (Edwards 2011, 2016) and innovation and sustainability (Sethi 2016; Venkatesan 2010). Alongside, fresh perspectives into textile makers?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 intelligence (Fee 2020; Sengupta 2021) and sensory perception of historical textiles and other artifacts (Houghteling 2022) situated Indian textiles in the intersection of art history, material culture, design history and practice-based studies. Drawing on these ongoing discussions, the course aims to broaden the scope to consider the concepts and tangible presence of textiles and allied practices and their deep impact on societies."
