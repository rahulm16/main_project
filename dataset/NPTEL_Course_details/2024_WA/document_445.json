    "content": "Korean I introduces students to the Korean language and culture as the first elementary course. Through this course, a foundation in communicative competence at the beginner level will be built. The course combines the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) and uses real-life scenarios to convey basic grammar and vocabulary. To ensure maximum exposure to the new language, classes are conducted as much as possible in Korean. Multimedia will be used to enhance language learning and cultural awareness.\n\nThe course assumes no prior knowledge of Korean. It is intended for the beginner who has never studied Korean formally but would like to develop proficiency step by step in the target language for social or professional purposes. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to demonstrate and use the knowledge, skills, and proficiency expected to some extent at the Level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) and Level I of the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK) in general."
