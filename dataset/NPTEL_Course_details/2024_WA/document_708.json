    "content": "The most important scientific and technical challenges facing humanity in the 21st century are energy security, environmental security and economic security; these can likely be met only through addressing the energy problem with in the next 10?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00c4\u00fa20 years. Meeting global energy demand in a sustainable fashion will require not only increased energy efficiency and new methods of using existing carbon based fuels but also renewable energy. Moreover, rising prices and sporadic shortages of fossil fuels provides the impetus for the present worldwide effort to develop alternative sources of energy. Solar energy is to be a major primary energy source; utilization requires solar capture and conversion. In this course we will discuss about various photovoltaics technologies, different generation of solar cells, device fabrication and characterization techniques and applications in industries."
