    "content": "Geography is the study of areal differentiation. It examines three questions - 1. What features (say mountains) and processes (such as volcanism) are found in different locations? 2. Why are they located where they are? 3. Where else on Earth do we find these specific features and processes? This governs several developmental decisions, such as location of mines, factories, towns, cities, and infrastructure. After all, mining will be economically feasible in areas that have a concentration of ores. Factories can easily be set up where we have availability of land, labour, capital and infrastructure. Towns and cities require land, infrastructure, water, etc. But at the same time, areal differentiation also governs the localisation of biodiversity - forests, wildlife, etc. - which need to be conserved to provide us with ecosystem benefits like food, water, disease control and employment. Past experience shows that if we are not careful, hasty developmental decisions harm biodiversity and conservation - especially when, say, developing mines in biodiversity-rich areas. This ultimately affects all of us - destruction of ecosystems, water flows and pollution wreck havoc to food and water security, health and economic development. The present course examines these concepts, beginning with the basics of Geography and Conservation, and looking at their interplay through several case studies to help reach conservation-oriented development."
