    "content": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized Bioscience, Biotechnology and Medicine through generating unprecedented amount of data in the fields of genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics. However, the data generated by NGS technologies has to be analyzed systematically to gain any meaningful information and to draw useful inferences. This course will describe the step-by-step process to analyze the data generated by NGS platforms along with relevant hands-on experience. The course will cover the analysis single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels. Further, the course will describe the complexities involved in the analysis of transcriptomic data in details. Finally, the course will end with an overview of other applications of the NGS technologies e.g., in genome assembly and epigenomics."
