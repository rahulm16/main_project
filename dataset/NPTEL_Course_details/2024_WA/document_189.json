    "content": "The course deals with design of steel structures using ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecLimit State Design Method?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9. The design methodology is based on the latest Indian Standard Code of Practice for general construction (IS 800:2007). The subject covers all the necessary components such as material specifications, connections and elementary design of structural members for designing industrial steel structures. The course provides material specifications and design considerations. It provides relevant material properties of different types of steel. It deals with two types of connections namely welded and bolted connections. The advantages and limitations of these two methods of connections are also spelt out. Eccentric connections due to different plane of loading for both bolt and weld are discussed. The course also comprises of analysis and design procedure of steel members under axial tension. Design of compression members, built-up compression members along with the batten and lacing systems are explained in in this course. It deals with the design procedures of flexural members having laterally supported and laterally unsupported beams. It comprises of design of various types of column bases which transfers different kind of loads from super structures to underneath soil. Design of gantry girder with reference to industrial applications is also demonstrated."
