It enables the speaker to have direct impact upon the audience and thus makes it an effective medium to exercise in diverse situations. However, not all the speakers are able to create the intended effect through their act of speaking due to their unfamiliarity with speech techniques and delivery nuances. Many of us, though competent enough, often feel anxiety about speech when called upon to speak in personal and public domains such as interviews, presentations, meetings, conferences, group discussions and many speaking related challenges in the present day ever changing corporate world. The purpose of this public speaking course is to develop the speech and personality of learners in order to convert them into confident, committed and effective speakers. The course will serve as a guide to various forms of public speaking with relevance to numerous emerging situational contexts and provide an overall development in speech delivery in a perspicuous manner."
