    "content": "This is a basic course on applications of laser technology in manufacturing. The subject laser technology has a very wide range of applications in the product development, manufacturing, surface engineering, and instrumentation. The course emphasizes the fundamental concepts of the laser technology viz. principle of working, characteristics, types, monitoring and control. There is a comprehensive coverage of physical concepts, process characteristics, mathematical formulations along with examples of various laser based manufacturing processes such as of laser machining (cutting), laser forming, laser welding, laser surface treatment and laser based additive manufacturing. There is a state-of-the-art description of newer and advanced applications of the lasers in industry. This course will be very useful to the students, practicing engineers and researchers. After completion of the course, the students will have a strong foundation on laser technology and will be able to apply the basic principles, process characteristics in the practical scenarios."
