    "content": "Carding and drawing are two fundamental process in yarn manufacture. In carding the fibre tufts are opened , cleaned and separated thoroughly by fast moving pinned surfaces and then reassembled to form a nice 2D array of fibres which is subsequently transformed into an uniform sliver. Drawframe is essentially a stretching device for sliver used to improve mass irregularity of sliver and parallelization of fibres"
