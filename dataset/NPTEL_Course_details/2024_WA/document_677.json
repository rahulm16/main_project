    "content": "Biomimicry is a practice that learns from and mimics the strategies found in nature to solve human challenges. Examples of biomimicry include everything from energy-producing solar cells that mimic tree leaves to antibacterial paints that emulate sharkskin to highly profitable businesses that improve their organizational structures based on redwood groves. Biomimicry is based on the principle that nature, with 3.8 billion years of wisdom, offers time-tested solutions to all our problems. We do not need to reinvent the strategies that are already here. We just need to learn how to adapt them."
