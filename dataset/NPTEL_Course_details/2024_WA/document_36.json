    "content": "This course introduces the students about Greenhouse Gas Protocols. The GHG protocol classifies emissions into three categories namely Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are direct emissions and can be impacted through easily achievable targets. One of the means to achieve Scope 1 & 2 emission reductions is shifting to Sustainable and Low Carbon Architecture. This course details out the understanding of GHG protocol and also the means to achieve the reductions under Scope 1 and 2 through Sustainable Building Design and Construction."
