    "content": "This is a basic analog electronics course. The most important objective for electronic circuits is to build an amplifier. This course will develop the principles behind the design of an amplifier. You should be able to design an operational-amplifier independently well before the end of the course. The course will use MOS devices exclusively. Other analog circuit building blocks such as voltage regulators and power amplifiers will also be discussed."
