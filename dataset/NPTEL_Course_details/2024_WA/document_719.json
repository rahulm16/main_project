    "content": "The course offers a profound understanding of the wave nature of light. This self-contained course begins with useful preliminaries related to the wave propagation and electromagnetic theory of light. Then the fundamental concept of various phenomenon like diffraction, interference and polarization will be developed gradually from scratch with detailed mathematical derivation. The course will be useful for UG students studying Physics."
