    "content": "The course focuses on understanding the science and technology of different forming processes. Most of the metallic objects undergo at least one of the metal forming operations, except the cast ones. Understanding basic principles of metal forming and further being applied by engineers and metallurgists directly contribute towards improvement in production in the industries. The concept of stress, deformation and failure, mechanics of metalworking and analysis of different metal working processes will be covered during the whole course. Introduction and working principle of powder metallurgy forging will be presented in the end. The course will enable the students be conversant with working principles so that they can use the knowledge gained towards increasing the productivity of manufacturing industries in the long run."
