    "content": "This is a basic course in Real Analysis which is a back bone of any course on pure & applied Mathematics and Statistics. This is a very useful course for any branch of science and engineering. The present course has been designed to introduce the subject to undergraduate/postgraduate students in science and engineering. The course contains a good introduction to each topic and an advance treatment of theory at a fairly understandable level to the students at this stage. Each concept has been explained through examples and application oriented problems"
