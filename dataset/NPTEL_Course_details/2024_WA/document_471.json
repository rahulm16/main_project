    "content": "Working capital management has gained the attention of industry and academia as an exclusive area of study after liberalization of Indian Economy. Management of working capital sometimes becomes more important than the management of long term funds because the day-to-day operations of any business largely depend upon this source of finance. Many firms have been seen in the past closing down for the want of short term finance. The profitability of any business to a larger extent is affected by this source of finance due to efficient management of current assets and current liabilities. Hence, learning about managing working capital has become more important and critical in the modern scenario."
