    "content": "This course serves as a general introduction to the field of cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology is referred to as the scientific study of advanced mental processes, such as organization of knowledge, reasoning, decision-making, language, problem solving, emotion etc. Following up on the course on basic cognitive processes the current course will build up on how the basic mental processes like memory, attention & perception give rise to higher-level cognitive processes. I will also talk about the methods used in contemporary Cognitive Psychology to investigate how these higher mental processes are used to achieve the desired outcomes. Some of the lectures will be about making students abreast of recent research in each of these topics."
