    "content": "This course covers the requirement of thorough subsurface investigation, its important in planning and execution of the project. Classification of investigations to be adopted and challenges faced during many of the most complex civil engineering projects across the globe. Detailed discussion on methodologies starting with borehole drilling, rock drilling to advance methods such as electrical resistivity, geophysical tests, sounding, magnetic anamoly, dilatometer test, pressuremeter tests, ground penetrating radar will be covered along with numerical problems at various stages. In addition, dynamic testing on piles which is a very hot topic these days will be covered in the course."
