    "content": "This course provides a quantitative treatment of symmetry in chemistry, using group theory. We start with determination of point group, discuss transformation matrices, abstract group theory, unitary transformations, derivation of Great Orthogonality Theorem and its consequences leading to character tables. Then, various applications in Chemistry are discussed. It is equivalent to CH 801 of IIT Bombay. The lectures are already recorded by CDEEP, IIT Bombay."
