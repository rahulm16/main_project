    "content": "The modern material assemblies require the combined use of alloys for a given commercial application. Welding technologies are of critical importance for the construction of virtually all components of the assemblies. This course aims to elaborate the physical principles of arc, plasma, laser, resistance spot, electron beam and solid state welding processes. This includes, physics of electric arc-plasma, engineering the arc-plasma for welding, metal transfer and mass flow in the weld pool, laser/electron beam - material interactions, pressure and force balance in keyhole mode power beam welding, fundamentals of heat generation by Joule heating and process principles and overview on types of resistance and solid state welding processes in Tamil."
