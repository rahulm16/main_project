    "content": "This course aims to fill the need for a comprehensive introduction to the analysis of biological systems in the continuum regime, in the context of transport (forces and fluxes). It aims to provide the student with the required skills to think-out-of-the-box in novelty requiring situations at one end, to a full appreciation of the relevant principles and their interconnections, at the other end. All the needed mathematical steps will be completely worked out to minimize the enormous time the students normally spend to understand the mathematical steps."
