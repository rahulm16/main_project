    "content": "The proposed course will provide basic understanding about groundwater engineering which will start with the introduction of surface and subsurface waters, different types of aquifers, various important concepts e.g. porosity, permeability, hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, types of flows etc. Further, the course would also discuss basic laws which govern groundwater flow. There will be discussion on importance of pumping tests, groundwater modelling and groundwater recharge techniques."
