    "content": "There is a need for machine tools and processes which can accurately and easily machine the most difficult-to-machine materials and workpieces with intricate and accurate shapes. In order to meet these challenges, a number of newer material removal processes have now been developed to the level of commercial utilization. These newer methods are also called unconventional in the sense that conventional tools are not employed for metal cutting. Instead, energy in its direct form is used to remove the material from the workpiece. This course aims at bringing the students up-to-date with the latest technological developments and research trends in the field of unconventional / nontraditional / modern machining processes."
