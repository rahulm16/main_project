    "content": "Various materials processes are used in variety of industries to create and form materials for wide range of applications. There are some commonalities behind all these processes and the aim of this course is to go through these fundamental physics and materials science behind these processes so as to be able to understand, design and predict the outcome of these methods. At the end of this course, students should be able to answer the following questions: (a) What are the various fundamental material processing techniques and the science behind it; (b) What processing method to use for a given material and a given application. This course is offered in two parts of 20 hours each. First part of the course deals with Solidification and Powder Metallurgy, while the second part deals with Metal processing and Thin film fabrication."
