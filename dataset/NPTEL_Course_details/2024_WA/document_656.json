    "content": "Aluminium and its alloys are of the most important class of engineering materials which are used in many applications starting from household to aircrafts. Given the wide range of applications of Al alloys the property requirements are also quite diverse. Therefore, understanding the structure-property correlation i.e. the Physical metallurgy of Al alloys is very important. Composites on the other hand supplement many of the properties needed in a particular application. This course will cover the aluminium alloys and their composites in the entirety. The objective is to learn about Al alloys and composites with an emphasis on the physical metallurgy and the structure-property correlation. It is expected that at the end of the course students will develop a clear understanding on Al alloys, Physical metallurgy and Metal matrix composites."
