    "content": "Every single cell in human body is constantly engaged in millions of chemical reactions that are vital to the survival of the cell and, by extension, the entire human body. The term \"metabolism\" is used to describe the sum total of a cell's chemical reactions. It encompasses intake, utilization, transport, breakdown and formation of different biomolecules which themselves are interconnected to each other through a complex metabolic web. The course will provide a detailed in-depth knowledge to the major metabolic pathways from a clinical perspective. It will also discuss the important human diseases related to metabolism."
