    "content": "This is course is meant to introduce students to the idea of modelling and simulation of communication systems exhibiting while highlighting the underlying stochastic behavior of these systems. The key objectives of this course are twofold: To introduce the importance of Monte Carlo methods for analyzing the behavior of communication systems. To encourage students to model and analyze stochastic systems around them. By the end of this course, the students will be able to confidently program in MATLAB and develop programming models for simulating communication systems."
