    "content": "This course will emphasize on developing intuition behind frequency synthesizer design, learning mathematical basis behind operation, and realizing PLLs at architecture and circuit level. The students will be exposed to state-of-the-art frequency synthesis techniques used in analog/digital integer-N PLLs. This course will equip students with skills to analyze, debug, and evaluate a PLL design at analytical and transistor levels both. The students will be able to use their knowledge and skills while generating a clock signal in a power-efficient manner for requirements of a synchronous system."
