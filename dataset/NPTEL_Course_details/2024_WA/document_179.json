    "content": "A good understanding about the mechanics behind the load transfer mechanism and the stability of different geotechnical structures constructed in/on the rocks becomes very much essential for the civil and mining engineers. On the other hand, the tunneling is a very efficient solution for the public transport as well as other underground transport systems. The course ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00c0\u00faRock Mechanics and Tunneling?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2 will give an overall idea about the rock mechanics and its applications."
