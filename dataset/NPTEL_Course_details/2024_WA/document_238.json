    "content": "We are in the era of multi-core systems where even the simplest of handheld devices like a smart phone houses many processors in a single chip. The core counts are ever increasing from 8 to 10 in smart phones to over 100s in super computers. This course will introduce the students to the world of multi-core computer architectures. With the unprecedented growth of data science, on-chip storage systems and inter-core communication framework are getting equal attention as that of processors. This course will focus on delivering an in-depth exposure in memory-subsystems and interconnects of Tiled Chip Multi-Core Processors with few introductory sessions on advanced superscalar processors. The course concludes with pointers to current research standings and on-going research directions for motivating the students to explore further"
