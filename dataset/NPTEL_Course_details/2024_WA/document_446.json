    "content": "In over 300 villages in Tamil Nadu, the Mahabharata is celebrated as a unique festival. The Epic is performed as village rituals, sung/narrated as a story, and enacted right through the night in a traditional masked theater form called the Koothu. It is an immersive experience of the Epic and entire villages relive the Epic for twenty days each year. Each family in the village contributes money for the festival making this possibly the oldest independent theater festival in the world currently."
