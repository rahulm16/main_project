    "content": "German 3 will build upon the courses German 1 and German 2, which are already being offered on the NPTEL platform since two years. The overall objective of this course is to acquire good knowledge of the German language, corresponding to the B1 proficiency level of the European Common Framework of Reference for Languages.B1 is the proficiency level required to be eligible to study in Germany, Austria and at several important universities in Switzerland, and to be able to work in these countries. Through this course we hope to bring your German language competence to a level where you would be able to qualify B1 level exams conducted by certifying institutions, and thus acquire the language eligibility to study work in Germany (as required as of today by most institutions and organizations)."
