    "content": "Increasingly, happiness, wellbeing and quality of life are seen as not just about feeling satisfied and happy, but also about having a purposeful life. This includes making a contribution to our family and community, and fulfilling our potential in terms of our own abilities and capacities. Thus, we can apply sustainable happiness to meet our global learning needs, individually and collectively. It is an invitation for all of us to stretch ourselves to be both a choice-maker and a change-maker to contribute to sustainable happiness of the society."
