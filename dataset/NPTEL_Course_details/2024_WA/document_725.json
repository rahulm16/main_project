    "content": "In this course, we propose a basic understanding of the memory process. The course lectures will introduce the student to the fundamental rule that determines memory processes through a historical perspective. We will present several paradigms used to date to investigate memory consolidation, modifications, and reconsolidation. Modern research methods and techniques shed deeper insight on human memory and its underlying mechanism. This course will help the students in understanding the core concepts that are foundational to the study of human memory. We will also learn about the malleable nature of memory and its boundary conditions. The course will be helpful to those who are studying education, health sciences, psychological sciences and related disciplines."
