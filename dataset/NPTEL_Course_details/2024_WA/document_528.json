    "content": "Phase diagram is the basis for understanding the behavior of materials under equilibrium. It has its importance in deciding the phase evolution with the variation of pressure, temperature and composition. Moreover, it helps in understanding the processing of the materials, mainly heat treatment. For material development as well as processing, one must have good knowledge in materials phase diagram."
