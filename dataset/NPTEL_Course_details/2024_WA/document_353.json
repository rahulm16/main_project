    "content": "Water is a fundamental natural resource that influences human health, ecology and economic development. Almost all activities such as domestic, agriculture and industrial demand we use water. Although water in nature is the most important and abundant compound but less than 1% of world water resources is available for our use. Though the world has achieved tremendous progress in all fields of science and technology but adequate and safe drinking water is still a distance dream for many people. This is due to the uneven distribution of water. Hence, there is a need to find out the availability and management of the water resources of our country with natural perspective."
