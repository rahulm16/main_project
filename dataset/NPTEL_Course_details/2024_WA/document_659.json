    "content": "The objective of the course is to provide a broad overview about different techniques available for structural characterization of various materials systems. It is an amalgamation of the science behind these characterization techniques and their application in material systems. The course is divided into two segments dealing with two major aspects of material structures and characterization; initial part will focus on imaging the microstructure by various microscopy techniques while the later part will deal with understanding the internal structure by diffraction phenomena."
