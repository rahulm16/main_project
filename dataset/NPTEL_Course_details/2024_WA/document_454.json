    "content": "As technology is evolving by leaps and bounds, protection and enforcement of intellectual property is becoming day by day critical. This puts the legal system into a challenging situation as definitions and scope of the current statutory system may not accommodate the intricacies of new technologies. In such a scenario the court system plays a major role in safeguarding the rights of the creators, businesses and inventors, by thorough deliberation and disposal of the matter. This course will focus on theoretical and practical nuisances of such IP litigation. Thorough case analysis will provide comprehensive content for learners to plan the IP lifecycle management, especially enforcement and infringement related activities efficiently."
