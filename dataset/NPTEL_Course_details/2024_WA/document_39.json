    "content": "Students as a beginner in the trade of Architecture through this course will get exposed to the different materials used in building construction. Conventional materials would be discussed with an outline of its manufacturing or procuring process, properties, applications and simultaneously the alternative materials replacing them would be also covered. A number of engineered materials have come up in use in the building industry as a substitute of the original material like engineered wood replacing wood or AAC and flyash bricks replacing clay bricks. A coverage on such alternate materials would be included. Large span and highrise structures use composite flooring system or steel for structural system, use of precast walling and flooring systems for fast delivery are other contents to expose students to other material applications in building industry. Finishes as in floors and walls like tiles, stone and clay tile cladding, paints and their appropriateness on different surfaces would be discussed. Nanotechnologies used in this trade would also be mentioned for specific materials stating their use. Specific ways of assembling different materials would also be highlighted to give consolidated knowledge to the students."
