    "content": "Geoengineering is an interdisciplinary facets concern to the response and behaviour of geoground and geomaterials. It uses principles of soil mechanics and rock mechanics in solving varieties of engineering issues arises during and after the development and expansion programs.\n\nThe basic aims of such engineering to translate the information released from geoground during its interactions with different kinds and natural and technogenic changes\n\nIn this way, the geotechnical engineering is ensuring the sound, safe, stable, naturally compact, environmentally sustainable and economically feasible development of various kinds of facilities for safe, and environmentally sustainable extraction of renewable and non-renewable energies, settlement, environmental and climatic issues for prosperous and healthy progress of society and existing ecosystem. This course is broadly designed to emphasize the involvements of geotechnical engineering in different areas of advances in progress of civilization, thus this course will useful for students and professional belonging to earth sciences, petroleum, civil, mining and environmental engineering for understanding, conceptualizing and solving numerous types of geotechnical problems arises during development and expansion programs for human safety, economy and welfare. This course is also significant to consultants and engineers working with geoground on different aspects."
