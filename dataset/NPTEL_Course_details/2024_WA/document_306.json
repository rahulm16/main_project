    "content": "The course Analysis and Design principles of Microwave Antennas covers a broad spectrum of the antenna design and analysis, starting with the basic concepts of microwave radiation to numerical computation of antenna currents, Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs), antenna pattern synthesis, etc. This course will not only help the undergraduate and graduate students by providing fundamental concepts of antenna theory but also help the design engineer to get familiar with different state of the art techniques of antenna analysis and design. In a nutshell, this course would lay the foundation for further exploring the vast area of microwave antenna analysis and design."
