    "content": "The course will cover basic concepts of Machine Learning ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00c4\u00fa supervised and unsupervised learning, along with algorithms like K-nearest neighbors, Decision Trees, Perceptrons, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, K-means, Hierarchical Clustering etc. Each algorithm will be motivated by possible applications in different domains, especially text and images. The aim will be to convey the ideas and intuitions of the algorithms, avoiding mathematical details. The medium of instruction will be in Bengali."
