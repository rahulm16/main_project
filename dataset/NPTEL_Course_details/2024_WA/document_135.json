    "content": "The course provides an in-depth study into protein structure and function. Building up from an understanding of amino acids and the peptide bond that form the basics of protein structure, protein folding and denaturation will be studied followed by the techniques used for protein isolation and characterization. The importance of metalloproteins and motor proteins will be followed by a discussion on membrane proteins and transport."
