This course provides theoretical and thermodynamic background for steam and gas power cycle, refrigeration cycle, psychometric principles, internal combustion engine and gas turbine engine cycles, aircraft and rocket propulsion cycles. Prior to these topic, few lectures are devoted towards basic engineering thermodynamic fundamentals. The syllabus is framed with respect to guidelines of ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8?\u00ecMechanical/Energy Engineering?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00f9 UG course curriculum for respective engineering disciplines across the country. The methodical online teaching, problem solving approach and online evaluation will help the candidate for credit transfer for their course curriculum."
