    "content": "The course can be broadly classified as a Physical Organic Chemistry course. Understanding organic reaction mechanisms are extremely useful in predicting the products and improving the reaction efficiency. A student needs to know basic concepts in order to be able to write reasonable reaction mechanisms. A mechanism cannot be considered valid unless there is experimental evidence to support it. The student needs to know basic experiments that can be used to validate reaction mechanisms. Learning outcomes for the course: At the end of the course, the student should be able to ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00a2 Propose/write a mechanism for a given organic reaction. ?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u00ac\u00a2 Design experiments to determine reaction intermediates/mechanisms."
