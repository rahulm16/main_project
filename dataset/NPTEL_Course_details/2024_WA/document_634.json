    "content": "All engineering activities (design/ manufacturing/ operation/ servicing) for any product from any discipline involve a team of people who communicate graphically. Hence, every engineer must have exposure and some competence in presenting ideas as pictures, and be able to unambiguously interpret drawing from others. This course will help develop basic visualization competency as well as ability to representing ideas on both paper and computer."
