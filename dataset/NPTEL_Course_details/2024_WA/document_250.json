    "content": "With the growth of Information and Communication Technology, there is a need to develop large and complex software. For developing large software, software developers should have enough proficiency of data structures and algorithms. Further, those software should be platform independent, Internet enabled, easy to modify, secure, and robust. To meet this requirement object-oriented paradigm has been developed and based on this paradigm the Java programming language emerges as the best programming environment. Now, Java programming language is being used for mobile programming, Internet programming, and many other applications compatible to distributed systems. This course aims to cover the essential topics of data structures and algorithms and how the same can be implemented using Java programming language. The participants of the proposed course will be able to improve their skills, to cope with the current demand of IT industries and solve many problems in their own filed of studies."
