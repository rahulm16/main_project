    "content": "This is an undergraduate course on Newtonian mechanics. My intents are - (i) to show engineering students that mechanics is not merely memorizing formula, by emphasizing on basic physical principles, (ii) to show science students that mechanics is not only about abstract concepts but there are interesting real-life, engineering applications. The USP of the course is to motivate the discussion through examples covering everyday life situations where a system can be modeled as a point particle, a collection of point masses or a rigid body."
