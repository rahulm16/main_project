    "content": "The objective of the course is to familiarize students with the current issues and debates concerning development. The concept of development, as historically conditioned, has had several connotations, starting from incessant preoccupation with economic growth during the years following independence to the current engagement with the human and social development with active inclusion of local communities in the process. The course attempts to understand the current practices of development by an analysis of the approaches, agencies and issues involved in it."
