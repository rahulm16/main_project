    "content": "Chemical engineering consists of several unit operations and unit processes. Before the reaction step, the raw materials should be processed through various unit operations and similarly after the reaction step as well the products are passed through various unit operations either for product separation or for purity. Thus unit operations are very essentially part of the chemical engineering; and hence, basic knowledge about the principles and equipment of solid-solid unit operations and solid-liquid unit operations is mandatory for any professional chemical engineer."
