    "content": "Organic chemical industry may be crudely grouped as natural and synthetic chemical industry. Natural product industries may include production of edible and essential oils, soaps and detergents, paints and varnishes, sugar and starch, pulp and paper, etc. while the synthetic chemical industries may include production of petrochemicals, polymers, etc. Thus this course would present manufacturing processes of various natural and synthetic organic chemicals along with required raw materials, process chemical reactions, process flow charts, major engineering problems and economics of each individual organic chemical."
