    "content": "Metals are the vital component of any biosystem. Starting from transporting biochemicals to catalyzing biochemical transformations, almost every process requires presence of a metal center. In order to understand these processes knowledge of specific functions carried out by these metals are necessary. This course will be helpful to understand the fundamental properties of the metals present in biosystems and mechanism of their action."
