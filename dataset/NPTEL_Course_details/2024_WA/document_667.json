    "content": "The primary aim of the proposed course is to teach the fundamentals and different processing techniques for fabricating composites and cellular materials, and make the students understand the structure- property relationship to facilitate developing novel materials. The course will begin with a discussion about the materials selection aspects for components design to understand the need for composite materials development and how to select its components. Subsequently, the processing routes for different kinds of composites such as metal matrix composites, ceramic matrix composites, and polymer matrix composites, as well as cellular solids such as porous metals and ceramics and metal foams will be discussed. The different microstructural factors determining the properties of these materials will be discussed in detail, along with a brief overview of the different analytical micromechanical models used for predicting their important properties."
