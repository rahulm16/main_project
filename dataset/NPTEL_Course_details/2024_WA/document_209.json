    "content": "We want to count the number of roots of an algebraic system (over finite fields). This is a very difficult question in general (eg. #P-hard). However, there are fast algorithms known for special cases. In this course we will focus on the \"2-variable\"case, i.e. curves. This case already demands significant theory and has an amazing list of applications in computer science.We will cover some important aspects of this 20th century mathematics in a self-contained way, and see as many applications as time permits"
