    "content": "The course would provide discussion on different formation evaluation tools such as Mudlogs and Cuttings, Gamma ray, Resistivity & Porosity, and several other logs. The course would offer insight into the open-hole log interpretation methods to evaluate the formation rock and fluid type, porosity, reservoir thickness and water & oil saturation, etc. The participants would be able to determine the volume of Hydrocarbons present in the reservoir and it?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s potential to flow through reservoir rock into the wellbore."
