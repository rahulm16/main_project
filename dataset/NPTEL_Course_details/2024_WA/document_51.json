    "content": "Cancer research has been significantly aided by advancements in proteogenomics technologies, where proteomics information derived from mass spectrometry is used to complement genomics using next generation sequencing. With the recent advent of Cancer Moonshot Project, the critical role that proteogenomics can play in improving cancer patient treatment is increasingly being recognized. This workshop will utilize advanced genomic and proteomic technologies and their data from high-quality human biospecimens to identify potentially actionable therapeutic molecular targets. This course is a part of a workshop by experts in the fields of proteomics and proteogenomics in cancer research from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The course will comprise interactive lectures with case studies, hands-on sessions and demonstrations on proteogenomics aimed at accelerated understanding of cancer. This course will cover the principles of proteogenomics followed by experimental sessions, where proteomics data using LC-MS/MS will be processed and analyzed. The next step will be to integrate the proteomics data with genomics data, from The Cancer Genome Atlas for the proteogenomics analysis. Lectures and demonstrations on different computational methods will be performed for statistical data analysis of proteogenomics data."
