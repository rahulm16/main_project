    "content": "This course will introduce abstract groups. We will start with definitions, basic properties and constructions and cover many important theorems in basic group theory, such as Lagrange?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s theorem, Cauchy?\u00a2\u201a\u00c7\u00a8\u201a\u00d1\u00a2s theorem and Sylow theorems. A major emphasis of the course will be to present numerous worked-out examples and problems. A part of the lecture every week will be devoted to explicit calculations."
