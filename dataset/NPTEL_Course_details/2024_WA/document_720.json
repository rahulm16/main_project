    "content": "This course introduces LASER to senior undergraduate students, as well as first year postgraduate students. The objective is to provide a detailed account of the basic physics, including resonator physics, and the principle of operation of Lasers. Issues relevant to the design and output characteristics of the Lasers, and some specific laser systems would also be discussed. The course is ?applied? in nature, and could be taken by B.E/B.Tech IIIrd/ IVth Year, M.Sc IInd/ M.Tech. I Year. Working engineers/scientists/teachers, who did not have exposure to the subject earlier, would also find it very useful, if interested. The course would require a regular and serious study schedule on the part of the students (to understand the subject and do well)."
