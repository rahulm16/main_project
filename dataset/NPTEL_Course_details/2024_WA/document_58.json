    "content": "This is a course designed primarily for students in the undergraduate or master\u2019s programs interested in bioprocess development for production of high value products from plant cells and tissue cultures. This course is expected to introduce the student to identify the industrial applications of Plant Cell/Tissue Culture Technology. The student will be able to develop plant cell/tissue culture based bioprocesses for large scale in vitro production of high value phytochemicals. Strategies that can be utilized to improve yield and productivity of phytochemicals from plant cell/tissue cultures with case studies will be discussed."
