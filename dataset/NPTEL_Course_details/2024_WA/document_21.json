    "content": "This course will cover basics of processing and preservation technologies required in any processing industries. The basic knowledge onthermal processing is intermingled with most of the unit operations at some or other stage of processing. Since, these basic aspects of thermal operationsis not taught in most of the engineering institutions elaborately, a comprehension of these aspects of thermal processing will enrich the knowledge base of the students in general."
