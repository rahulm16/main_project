    "content": "This course covers introductory topics in Classical and Quantum Fields that are typically not given due importance in the M.Sc. coursework. There is a considerable knowledge gap between the present day M.Sc. level courses and actual PhD level research in theoretical physics. The contents of this course are carefully chosen to fill this gap and help aspiring/early stage PhD scholars come up to speed with research level topics in theoretical physics."
